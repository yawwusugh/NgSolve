This repository contains an interactive Jupyter files for our NGSolve demos
---

The repository consists of jupyter-notebooks with code showing demos of experiments we did with the Python interface to the NGSolve Finite Element
library. It allows one to experiment with the files.
Try the demos out without installing the NGSolve library on your computer by clicking on the 'launch binder' logo:

The first time launching it may take a few minutes. When it's ready,
you can work through the demos pressing "shift-enter". 

Happy collaborating!
